# Draggable-MenuBoxes

Draggable-MenuBoxes is a sophisticated web project designed to enhance user interaction by incorporating draggable menu boxes that can be moved seamlessly across the screen. Each menu box contains well-organized content, including informational text, a document icon, a download option, a download icon, and a file size indicator. The styling of these elements is meticulously crafted using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, modern, and responsive design. The dynamic and smooth motion of the draggable boxes is powered by Framer Motion, a robust React library for animations. This combination of Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animation creates an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, allowing users to interact with and organize the menu boxes effortlessly within the interface.
